# The Components

## Arduino Uno

Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board used for building electronic projects. It is easy to program and connects sensors, motors, and other components to create interactive devices. ðŸš€

- **Analog In:** Which is our trigger and connected to the sensor
- **Digital Out:** Which sends our input to the the code
- **5V:** Which is our power
- **GND:** Wich is the ground. (GND is the point in a circuit where the electricity flows back to complete the circuit.)

<summary>More About Arduino Uno</summary>
The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board used for building digital and analog projects. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of its key components:

**Digital Pins (0-13):**

Used for digital input/output (high/low signals). *For example: LED Pins that "blink".*


**Analog Pins (A0-A5):**

Used for analog input (sensing voltage levels). *For example: Sensors, motors, temperatur measurement input*

**Power Pins:**

**5V:** Supplies 5V power to your circuit.

**GND:** Ground pin for completing circuits.

**Vin:** Input voltage pin for external power sources.

**Reset Button:**

Resets the microcontroller when pressed.

**USB Port:**

Used for programming the board and powering it from a computer.

**Power LED & Status LED:**

Indicate the boardâ€™s power status and program execution.

## Breadbord

A breadboard is a reusable board for prototyping circuits without soldering. It allows easy connections using jumper wires and electronic components. âš¡

- The side power rails distribute power (+ and -).
- The main grid connects components in rows.

<summary>More About Breadbords</summary>

A breadboard is used for prototyping electronic circuits without soldering. Here's the essential layout:

**Power Rails:**

+ rail (red): For positive voltage.
- rail (blue/black): For ground.
Main Grid:

**Rows:**

Columns A-E and F-J are electrically connected in each row. Place components in these rows, but donâ€™t mix A-E with F-J.

**Columns:**

The rows are connected internally in groups (e.g., A1-A5, B1-B5), allowing easy connections between components.

## The Sensor

The HC-SR04 is an ultrasonic sensor that measures distance using sound waves. It sends a sound pulse and calculates the time it takes to return, determining the object's distance. ðŸ”Š 

The ultrasonic sensor has four little legs `GND` `Echo` `Trig` `Vcc`. Each pin has a specific function:

**GND:** Stands for *Ground*. It connects to the negative (-) side of the power supply, completing the circuit.

**Echo:** Sends a signal back to the microcontroller after the sound wave bounces off an object. The time it takes helps calculate distance.

**Trig:** Short for *Trigger*. The microcontroller sends a pulse to this pin to initiate the ultrasonic sound wave.

**VCC:** Supplies power to the sensor, usually 5V from the microcontroller or power source.
These four pins work together to measure distances using sound waves. ðŸŽ¯


# Assemble

## 1. Connect Sensor and Board

First we will need to connect the Sensor with the Breadbord. Anywhere is fine.

## 2. Connect Board and Arduino

Connect using the cables the Breadbord with the Arduino as follows: 

`VCC`-> 5V
`Trig`-> 3 (Analog)
`Echo`-> 2 (Analog)
`Gnd`-> GND
